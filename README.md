# Cobra [ ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flatmap/cobra.svg?branch=master) ](https://travis-ci.org/flatmap/cobra)

Cobra is a modern code and proof presentation framework, leveraging cutting-edge presentation technology together with a state of the art interactive theorem prover to present formalized mathematics as active documents. Cobra provides both an easy way to present proofs and a novel approach to auditorium interaction. The presentation is checked live by the theorem prover, and moreover allows live changes both by the presenter as well as the audience.

Cobra currently supports [**Isabelle**](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/index.html) proofs. Support for [**Coq**]() will follow at a later point. 

Thanks to the great Isabelle/ML integration, Cobra is also suitable for presentations of [**Standard ML**](http://sml-family.org) code.

In addition, Cobra has (early) support for [**Scala**](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [**Haskell**](http://haskell.org) code. Consider these two modes not production ready. They are ready to play around, but are not stable, and don't support any kind of execution of code.

## Install **Cobra** 1.0.5

> **Note, that Java 8 or higher is required for cobra to run.**
> **It will fail to start, when used with Java 7 or below!**

### Windows

Download [zip](https://github.com/flatmap/cobra/releases/download/version-1.0.5/cobra-1.0.5.zip) and extract anywhere; Add `bin/cobra.bat` to your PATH.

### macOS

Until the notability of the cobra GitHub repository meets the requirements of homebrew-core, we have an own tap:

```sh
brew tap flatmap/cobra
brew install cobra
```

### Fedora / RHEL

There is a YUM repository available which provides automatic updates

```sh
wget https://bintray.com/flatmap/rpm/rpm -O bintray-flatmap-rpm.repo
sudo mv bintray-flatmap-rpm.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo dnf install cobra
```

### Ubuntu / Debian

There is a PPA available for Debian / Ubuntu. Releases are signed with bintray's private key. To add the public key please ececute

```sh
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 379CE192D401AB61 
```

Now you can add the repo and install cobra

```sh
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/flatmap/deb wheezy main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cobra-presentations
```

### Other Platforms

Download [zip](https://github.com/flatmap/cobra/releases/download/version-1.0.5/cobra-1.0.5.zip) and extract anywhere; Add `bin/cobra` to your PATH.

## Getting Started

Cobra presentations are viewed in the browser. Cobra starts a very light and fast web server for every presentation.

Every presentation has an own directory. Every file within the presentation directory is served as a static resource to the web browser.

 * **Create a new presentation**: call `cobra new` from the command line and follow the instructions
 * **Start the presentation server**: call `cobra` in the directory of the presentation. Or `cobra <dir>` where `<dir>` is the presentation directory.
 * **View the presentation**: Navigate to localhost:8080 with your web browser.
 * **Edit your presentation**: Configuration can be edited in `cobra.conf`, content in `slides.html`. There is no need to restart the presentation server. Changes will be immediately visible in the browser, when files are changed.

### Presentation Format

The content of a presentation is stored in a file called `slides.html`. Cobra will support a MarkDown slide format in Version 1.2.

To add a slide, simply add `<section>` tags to the `slides.html` file. For the general slide format please refer to the **reveal.js** [documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

#### Including Code Snippets

The simplest option is to include inline code snippets:

```html
<code class="scala">
  case class Person(name: String, age: String)
  object Test {
    val p = Person("Albert Einstein", ???)
  }
</code>
```

This will produce a code snippet, which will be semantically treated by the scala compiler. It is possible to edit the code in the presentation, just as in an IDE. It is also possible to select parts of the code (e.g. identifiers) to display semantic information about the code.

To include Isabelle or Haskell simply replace `scala` class with `isabelle` or `haskell`

> Note: When including Isabelle inline you will want to set the `id` of the `code` tag to the name of your theory, because otherwise a name for your theory is generated and will most definitely clash with what you define in your header. (see #12)

#### Configuring Inline Messages

It is possible to **show inline states** (for Isabelle) by adding the class `states` to a code tag

If you want to **step through states**, you can additionally add the class `state-fragments`

You can **hide info messages** by adding `no-infos` class

You can **hide warning messages** by adding `no-warnings` class

#### External Sources

It is possible to include external source files. Simply place a code file within the folder of the presenation. (e.g. `<presentation root>/src/Test.scala`)

You can then include the snippet with

```html
<code src="src/Test.scala"></code>
```

Note, that you don't have to specify the language in this case, since it is recognised from the file extesion.

#### Advanced Inclusion Options

Often it is desired to include only parts of larger examples, for example omitting all imports for the presentation:

This can be done with special comments:

```scala
import system.io._

Object Example {
  /// begin #example
  val x = 7

  /// begin #def-f
  def f(y: Int) = ???
  /// end #example
  /// end #def-f
}
```

The comments won't be shown in the presentation and the sub-snippets can be included as such:

```
<code src="#example></code>
```

Note that, the sub-snippets may be nested or even overlapping as in the example and included in several editors. They will always stay in sync.

The language mode is derived from the super-snippet.

It is also possible to hide snippets. This is convenient, when super snippets shall not be included in the presentation. This can be done by adding the class `hidden` to a code snippet.

The comment syntax for Haskell and Isabelle is as follows:

```haskell
--- begin #snippet-name
haskell code
--- end #snippet-name
```

```ml
(** begin #snippet-name *)
isabelle code
(** end #snippet-name *)
```

Snippet names are global and thus have to be unique.

#### Code Fragments

Within presentations it is desirable to not show everything at the beginning or exchange parts of the code. This can be achieved with special syntax:

```scala
val x = /*(*/???/*|3 * 7)*/
// or
val x = /*(???|*/3 * 7/*)*/
```

will result both in the following sequence


```scala
val x = ???
```

*hit next*

```scala
val x = 3 * 7
```

The difference in the two lines is just their meaning in the source file.

Again the syntax for Haskell and Isabelle is analogous:

```haskell
fibs = {-(-}undefined{-|0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs))-}
```

```isabelle
lemma x: "A ==> A" (*(*)oops(*|by auto)*)
```

#### Selection Fragments

It is also possible to select parts of the code automatically as such:

```scala
val x = /*(*/7/*)*/
```

```haskell
x = {-(-}7{-)-}
```

```isabelle
lemma x: "A ==> (*(*)A(*)*)"
```

They will act the same as manual selections, displaying semantic information about the selected portion.

In Version 1.1, it will be possible to annotate custom text to selected portions.

## Configuration

The file `cobra.conf` can be edited while the server is running, any change will have immediate effect, when the file is saved. Any running presentation will be updated in the browser, this way you can play around with setting until they suit your needs.

`cobra.conf` is a [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) style configuration file with the following defaults:

```
cobra {
  // display title of the presentation
  title = "Cobra"
  // display language of the presentation
  language = "en"
